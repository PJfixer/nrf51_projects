# nRF51822 Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure Sensor Project

This project utilizes the nRF51822 chip to create a sensor for measuring temperature, humidity, and pressure, capable of broadcasting this data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The project is designed to be ultra-low power.

## Features

- Measurement of temperature, humidity, and pressure using the BME280 sensor.
- Transmission of measured data via BLE using BLE advertisements.
- Power management for minimal energy consumption.
- Storage of the device name in flash for easy customization.
